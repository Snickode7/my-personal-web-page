            <ul class= myList id="fontsandstuff">
                <li><span id="boldName">Jacob:</span> Jacob was diagnosed with high-functioning autism at an early age.  I worked with Jacob on many different goals.  One of the most important things we worked on was job placement.  After a couple of months, we were able to get him a part-time job at Kroger.  This was a huge step forward in Jacob's development on becoming a fully independent adult.   </li>
                <li><span id= "boldName">Christian:</span> Christian has low-functioning autism with limited speech capabilities.  My main goal with Christian was to help him with communication and getting him to be able to interact with people out in the community. Christian made huge strides in these areas while I worked with him. </li>
                <li><span id= "boldName">Robert:</span> Robert was a very independent man who was born with a developmental disability and lower IQ.  My duties with Robert included weekly trips to the doctor and many other trips around the city of Louisville.  My main accomplishment with Robert was helping him find an affordable place to live and to help him live a more healthy life.</li>
                <li><span id="boldName">Corey:</span> I have been working with Cory for four years.  Corey has Down Syndrome and is an amazing person.  Corey has two jobs and is constantly working on becoming a more active member of society.  Corey and I are currently working on many exciting goals and are taking huge steps forward everyday.</li>
            </ul>
              
             <p class= "opening" id="fontsandstuff">I know that choosing someone to work for your child is a very important decison.  I don't take this decision lightly and want you to know as much about me as possible before we can meet in person.    </p>
