# my-personal-web-page
This is the project that I made for Code Louisville.

I made a personal web page to advertise my independent contracting bussiness. I provide Direct Support for people with disabilites. In my project I tried to make a responsive web page that would hopefully help people to get to know me better before they make a decision on who the want as a provider. I also added a lightbox photo gallery and a dropdown navigation menu. Its far from done but I think it's a good start.

To access my web site, run the index.html file in a text editor and click the nav links to move around the site.
